Movie Recommendation System

The goal of this project is to develop a content-based movie recommendation system.

Data Exploration:
For this project, we utilized the MovieLens dataset, which can be found at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/. We merged two key tables, namely "movie" and "rating," based on the "movieId" column.

Insights from Data Analysis:
During our data exploration phase, we made the following observations:

Most Common Ratings: The most frequent rating given by users is 4, followed by 3. The highest rating, 5, comes in third place.
Popular Genres: Comedy, drama, thriller, and action are the most prevalent genres among the movies in the dataset.
By leveraging these insights, we aim to build an effective content-based recommendation system that suggests movies based on their genres and user preferences. Such a system can help users discover movies that align with their interests and enhance their overall movie-watching experience.
